### Stepwise Process for the Compressed Node Stage in Incident Handling for a Phishing Attack

1. **Initial Detection**: Monitor for indicators of phishing attempts, such as unusual email patterns, suspicious links, or reports from users.

2. **Data Collection**: Gather relevant data from affected systems, including email headers, URLs, and any attachments. This may involve using security tools to extract logs and metadata.

3. **Analysis of Indicators**: Analyze the collected data to identify common indicators of compromise (IOCs), such as sender addresses, domain names, and specific phrases used in the phishing attempt.

4. **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Cross-reference the identified IOCs with threat intelligence databases to determine if they are associated with known phishing campaigns or malicious actors.

5. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate the potential impact of the phishing attack on the organization, including the number of affected users and the sensitivity of the data at risk.

6. **Containment Strategy Development**: Develop a containment strategy based on the analysis, which may include blocking malicious URLs, disabling compromised accounts, and informing users about the phishing attempt.

7. **Communication Plan**: Prepare a communication plan to inform stakeholders, including IT teams, management, and affected users, about the incident and the steps being taken.

8. **Documentation**: Document all findings, actions taken, and communications for future reference and compliance purposes.

9. **Review and Feedback**: After the incident is contained, review the incident handling process to identify areas for improvement and update incident response plans accordingly.

### Inference Process

- **Initial Detection**: Extracted knowledge from the "Monitoring" node to identify phishing attempts.
- **Data Collection**: Utilized the "Data Gathering" node to understand the importance of collecting relevant data.
- **Analysis of Indicators**: Referenced the "Indicators of Compromise" node to analyze collected data.
- **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Drew from the "Threat Intelligence" node to enhance the analysis with external data.
- **Impact Assessment**: Used the "Risk Assessment" node to evaluate the potential impact of the incident.
- **Containment Strategy Development**: Leveraged the "Containment Strategies" node to formulate a response.
- **Communication Plan**: Referenced the "Stakeholder Communication" node for effective communication.
- **Documentation**: Extracted from the "Incident Documentation" node to ensure proper record-keeping.
- **Review and Feedback**: Utilized the "Post-Incident Review" node to improve future responses.
