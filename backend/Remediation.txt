Cyber Attack Type : Phishing
Incident Handling Phase : Remediation
Step 1: Triage and confirm incident report
1.a Initial Report Review: Gather all relevant information from the user who reported the phishing incident. This includes the email headers, content, and any links or attachments.
1.b Verify the Source: Check the sender's email address and domain against known phishing sources. Use threat intelligence feeds to confirm if the sender is associated with malicious activity.
1.c Analyze the Content: Examine the email content for common phishing indicators, such as urgent language, requests for sensitive information, or suspicious links. 
1.d Test Malware Eradication Procedure: If the phishing email contained attachments or links, simulate the opening of these in a controlled environment to determine if they contain malware. This helps confirm the threat level.
1.e Contain Phishing Sample Test Implementation: If the phishing email is confirmed, implement containment measures. This may involve blocking the sender's address and quarantining the email.
1.f Request System Patch, Rule Update, or Content Filter Modification: Based on the findings, request necessary updates to security systems. This could include patching vulnerabilities, updating email filtering rules, or modifying content filters to prevent similar incidents in the future.
1.g Document Findings: Record all findings, actions taken, and any changes made to security protocols. This documentation is crucial for future reference and for improving incident response processes.
1.h Communicate with Stakeholders: Inform relevant stakeholders about the incident, including IT teams, management, and affected users, to ensure awareness and preparedness for potential follow-up actions.
Step 2: Identify Compromised Accounts: Analyze logs and alerts to identify accounts that may have been compromised due to the phishing attack.
Step 3: Change Login Credentials: Immediately change the login credentials of the identified compromised accounts to prevent unauthorized access.
Step 4: Block Temporary Access: Temporarily block access to the compromised accounts to ensure that no further unauthorized actions can be taken while remediation is in progress.
Step 5: Notify Affected Users: Inform the users of the compromised accounts about the incident and the actions taken to secure their accounts.
Step 6: Monitor Account Activity: Implement monitoring on the affected accounts to detect any suspicious activity during the remediation process 
Step 7: Conduct a Root Cause Analysis: Investigate how the phishing attack occurred and identify any vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.
Step 8: Implement Security Measures: Based on the findings, implement additional security measures such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance account security.
Step 9: Educate Users: Provide training and resources to users on recognizing phishing attempts and best practices for account security.
Step 10: Eradicate malware
10.a Identify Affected Systems: Conduct a thorough investigation to identify all systems that may have been compromised due to the phishing attack. This includes user endpoints, servers, and any network devices.
10.b. Isolate Affected Systems: Immediately isolate the identified systems from the network to prevent further spread of malware and to protect other systems.
10.c Coordinate with 3rd Party Takedown Services: If the phishing attack involved malicious URLs or domains, coordinate with third-party takedown services to remove or disable these malicious resources.
10.d Implement Technical Counter-Measures: Deploy technical counter-measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and endpoint protection solutions to block any further attempts of malware installation or communication with command and control servers.
10.e URL Redirect with ISP: Work with your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to implement URL redirects for any known malicious URLs associated with the phishing attack, effectively preventing users from accessing these sites.
10.f Add/Change/Remove Affected Systems: Depending on the severity of the infection, you may need to add new systems, change configurations, or remove severely compromised systems from the network.
10.g Conduct a Full System Scan: Use updated antivirus and anti-malware tools to perform a comprehensive scan of the affected systems to identify and remove any remaining malware.
10.h Monitor for Residual Threats: After eradication, continuously monitor the affected systems for any signs of residual threats or reinfection.
10.i Document the Incident: Record all actions taken during the eradication process for future reference and to improve incident response protocols.
10.j Review and Update Security Policies: Post-incident, review and update security policies and training to prevent future phishing attacks.
Step 11: Communications
11.a Identify Stakeholders: Determine who needs to be informed about the phishing incident. This may include IT staff, management, affected users, and possibly external partners.
11.b Select Communication Method: Choose the most appropriate method for communication based on the urgency and audience. Options include:
   - Mobile Messaging: For quick alerts to team members.
   - Intranet Meeting: For internal discussions with relevant departments.
   - Internet Meeting: For remote teams or external stakeholders.
   - In-person Meeting: For critical discussions that require face-to-face interaction.
   - Direct Phone Call: For immediate communication with key personnel.
   - Conference Call: For involving multiple stakeholders simultaneously.
11.c Draft Communication: Prepare a clear and concise message outlining the incident, its impact, and any immediate actions that need to be taken. Ensure the message is tailored to the audience.
11.d Disseminate Information: Use the selected communication method to share the information with stakeholders. Ensure that all relevant parties receive the message promptly.
11.e Establish Feedback Mechanism: Allow stakeholders to ask questions or provide feedback regarding the incident. This can be done through follow-up meetings or dedicated communication channels.
11.f Document Communications: Keep a record of all communications related to the incident for future reference and compliance purposes.
11.g Review and Update: After the incident is resolved, review the communication process to identify any areas for improvement in future incident handling.
