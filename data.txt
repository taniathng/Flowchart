 Step = Phishing Detection

### Stepwise Process for Phishing Detection

1. **Conduct Content Scans**: Begin by scanning incoming emails for suspicious content. This includes looking for common phishing indicators such as urgent language, requests for sensitive information, and unusual attachments.

2. **Request Packet Capture**: If a suspicious email is identified, request packet captures to analyze the traffic associated with the email. This can help in identifying the source and any malicious links.

3. **Categorize Incident**: Classify the incident based on the type of phishing attack (e.g., spear phishing, whaling, etc.) to tailor the response strategy.

4. **Define Threat Indicators**: Establish specific threat indicators to look for:
   - Identification of spoofed emails.
   - Emails linked to external or unknown URLs.
   - Emails returned by mail servers as identified threats.

5. **Monitor Organization Websites**: Regularly check your organization's websites for any attempts to copy content or perform web scraping, which may indicate phishing attempts.

6. **Internal Notifications**: Encourage internal users to report any suspicious or fraudulent email activity. This can be facilitated through a dedicated reporting mechanism.

7. **Third-Party Notifications**: Stay in contact with third parties who may report suspicious activity related to your organizationâ€™s emails.

8. **Law Enforcement Notifications**: Be aware of any notifications from law enforcement regarding suspicious or fraudulent email activity that may involve your organization.

9. **ISP Monitoring**: Monitor for any notifications from your Internet Service Provider (ISP) regarding increased email or web traffic, both ingress and egress, which may indicate phishing activity.

10. **Web Log Monitoring**: Analyze web logs to identify any suspicious referrers that may be directing traffic to your website, particularly from known phishing sites.

11. **Automated Monitoring Systems**: Implement automated systems to monitor all the above sources. Ensure that any detection triggers an immediate alarm for rapid response.

12. **Specialized Mailing-Lists and Feeds**: Subscribe to specialized mailing lists or RSS/Twitter feeds that report phishing cases to stay informed about emerging threats.

13. **Active Monitoring of Phishing Repositories**: Deploy active monitoring of phishing repositories such as PhishTank and Google Safe Browsing to identify known phishing sites.

14. **Deploy Spam Traps**: Set up spam traps to gather spam emails from partners or third parties, which can provide insights into phishing tactics.

15. **Monitor Points of Contact**: Closely monitor all points of contact, including email and web forms, for any signs of phishing attempts.

### Inference Process

- **Step 1**: Extracted knowledge from "Conduct content scans" to initiate the detection process.
- **Step 2**: Used "Request packet capture" to analyze suspicious emails further.
- **Step 3**: Referenced "Categorize incident" to classify the type of phishing attack.
- **Step 4**: Defined threat indicators from "Define threat indicators" to establish criteria for detection.
- **Step 5**: Monitored organization websites based on "Monitoring of organization websites."
- **Step 6**: Incorporated "Notification from internal users" to enhance detection through user reports.
- **Step 7**: Utilized "Notification from 3rd parties" to gather external insights.
- **Step 8**: Included "Notification from Law Enforcement" for awareness of broader threats.
- **Step 9**: Leveraged "Notification from ISP" to monitor traffic anomalies.
- **Step 10**: Analyzed "Monitor your web logs" for suspicious referrers.
- **Step 11**: Implemented "Use automated monitoring systems" for real-time alerts.
- **Step 12**: Subscribed to "Monitor any specialized mailing-list" for ongoing threat intelligence.
- **Step 13**: Engaged with "Deploy active monitoring of phishing repositories" for proactive detection.
- **Step 14**: Set up "Deploy spam traps" to gather intelligence on phishing tactics.
- **Step 15**: Monitored "Monitor all your points of contact" to ensure comprehensive coverage.
